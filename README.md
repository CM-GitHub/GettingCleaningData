## Getting and Cleaning Data


This repository contains the file for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project.

Steps:
* Merge Training and Test Data Sets
* Extract Only Measurements on the Mean and Standard Deviation for Each Measurement
* Use Decriptive Activity Names to name activities in data set
* Appropriately Label Data Set with Decriptive Variable Names
* Transform Data Set into New Tidy Data Set Containing Average of Each Measurement by Activity and Subject

Run the R program file "run_analysis.R". A tidy data file "TidyData.txt" will be written to the working directory. 
Please ensure that the extracted data folders/files "UCI HAR Dataset" are in the same working directory
